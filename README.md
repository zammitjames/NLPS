NLPS - Natural Language Processing Summerizer
=============

NLPS is an automatic summarization tool making use of natural language processing algorithms that analyze, understand, and generate languages that humans use naturally. The aim of the project is to give an accurate short-summary of the inputted document/text.


### Installation
	
    Simply download the repository from github or clone it using your favorite client/terminal!
    >>> git clone https://github.com/zammitjames/NLPS.git
 
    You can test NLPS by running `python example.py`.
    
### Example
As a test I entered a descriptive document about the childhood of Steve Jobs, and the output returned was:
```
Shortly after Steve was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and had another child, Mona Simpson.
It was not until Jobs was 27 that he was able to uncover information on his biological parents.

As an infant, Steven was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven Paul Jobs.
Jobs tested so well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to high schoolâ€”a proposal that his parents declined.
A few years later, while Jobs was enrolled at Homestead High School (1971), he was introduced to his future partner, Steve Wozniak, through a friend of Wozniak's.
```

### Prerequisites

    >>> sudo pip install -nltk

### Adding to an existing python project

```python
    from nlps import nlps
    tt = nlps()
    tt.summarize(title, text)
```
